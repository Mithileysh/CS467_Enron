CS467_Enron
===========

This is a group project for CS 467 - Social Visualization Spring 14. 

We had all the Enron emails in a MongoDB and we processed the words via python.

We then visualized the frequency of certain key words in the Enron emails and used D3 (JavaScript) to visualize the frequency of 
key words that were related to the Enron case with respect to time and events happening during the Enron case
